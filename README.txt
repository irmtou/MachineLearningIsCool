# Machine Learning is Cool
In our hands on workshop, we'll dive into the exciting and practical applications of machine learning. Together we'll explore:

### 1. Spam Email Classifier with Naive Bayes 📧
Learn how ML helps differentiate spam emails from important ones using simple yet effective probabilistic models.

### 2. Image Color Clustering with K-means 🎨
Discover how unsupervised learning can extract dominant colors from images for tasks like design, art, and photo editing.

### 3. Object Detection with Deep Learning and YOLOv8 🔍
Witness how cutting-edge computer vision models identify objects in images and videos with remarkable speed and accuracy.

### 4. Generative Pre-trained Transformers with GPT-2 ✨
Explore how generative models create coherent, human-like text by predicting the next word in a sequence.
